## Urban systems and public health

Approximately 55\% of the global population lives in urban areas with this number expected to increase to two-thirds by 2050 [@UnitedNations2019]. Urbanization is accompanied by a suite of surface modifications that effect the surface-energy balance, hydrological flows, and the availability of vegetation, creating distinct and varied microclimates [@Pickett2001]. These modifications vary spatially, creating uneven landscapes of environmental externalities and benefits as well as infrastructure access. These spatial variations in turn affect and are effected by demographics and are often distinct along income and racial lines [@Heynan2006]. Systematic inequalities arise from zoning practices and disinvestment and have a long historical legacy [@Wolch2014]. These three subsystems–meteorological, physical, and social–are highly interdependent with complex feedbacks, and interact in complex ways characterized by non-linear dynamics and thresholding behaviors, operating across a variety of spatial and temporal scales [@Liu2007; @Liu2007a; @McPhearson2016]. Understanding the interactions of these subsystems is crucial to understanding cities as coupled human-natural systems, which is itself crucial to understanding the spatial variability of public health in urban areas.

Public health can be defined as the health of entire populations, from neighborhoods to cities to countries and on [@Trochim2006]. As the world becomes increasingly urban, understanding the dynamics of public health in urban environments and how they interact with climate, the environment, and society becomes increasingly important.  Understanding the structural variability of public health across these domains can allow for better public policies [@McPhearson2016].

It is intuitive to understand that weather has an effect on human health. Besides disasters like floods and tornadoes, everyday meteorological conditions effect health as well. Extremes of heat and cold can exacerbate existing conditions and effect cardiovascular and respiratory function and may lead to increased mortality [@ferreirabragaTimeCourseWeatherRelated2001; @sonejaExposureExtremeHeat2016]. Heat also facilitates the formation of ground-level ozone and precipitation and wind effect the severity of allergen concentrations. Atmospheric pressure and humidity likewise have effects on human health. These effects often occur at a temporal lag. Not only do atmospheric condictions affect public health, but they do so differentially across social groups [@Liu2007a].

Urban infrastructure and environment vary spatially within the urban context and are likely to produce variabilities in health based on proximity to features. Highways and railways are major sources of pollution as are power plants and other large electrical facilities. Greenspace is known to reduce land surface temperature just as impervious surfaces are known to increase it [@okeEnergeticBasisUrban1982]. Urban core areas are effected by the urban heat island where the increased percentage of impervious surfaces elevates temperatures. Age and material of housing stock are also likely to impact the health of residents [@stewartLocalClimateZones2012].

It is well known that large disparities of health outcomes exist across socio-economic spectra, with minorities and the poor having the worst outcomes [@geeEnvironmentalHealthDisparities2004]. These social determinants of health also vary spatially often along with the physical determinants of health present through racial segregation in the urban system [@geeEnvironmentalHealthDisparities2004; @hoffmanEffectsHistoricalHousing2020]. It is essential to understand how the social determinants interact with the climatic and physical systems to produce variabilities in public health vulnerability in order to prioritize the distribution of resources. 

Urban systems are complex and incorporate disparate elements usually siloed within separate disciplines [@Bai2018]. It is inefficient to study human and natural systems separately when attempting to undestand their interactions [@Liu2007a]. Likewise, research is usually done in the abstract, without a focused eye to solving real-world problems. Research should provide usable solutions [@Liu2007a; @McPhearson2016]. Addressing these problems successfully involves transdisciplinary work that can examine urban systems as intersections of social, physical, environmental, and atmospheric systems [@Bai2018; @McPhearson2016]. Understanding urban systems is a critical first step in understanding how they may respond to climate change [@Bai2018]. If risk can be understood quanititatively it can be projected under different climate change scenarios [@McMichael2012]. Measures of public health can be used as an outcome for modelling these coupled human and natural systems.

While there are many studies of the relationship between health outcomes in relation to urban heat, heat waves, and other atmospheric conditions like air pollution levels, the public health data are often too aggregated to get a sense of the spatial dependency of these relationships [@Anderson2009; @Ayres-Sampaio2014; @babinPediatricPatientAsthmarelated2007; @delamaterAnalysisAsthmaHospitalizations2012; @ferreirabragaTimeCourseWeatherRelated2001; @mirekuChangesWeatherEffects2009; @sonejaExposureExtremeHeat2016]. Patterns of these variables vary spatially [@okeEnergeticBasisUrban1982; @Jerrett2008super] in ways that affect exposure and health outcomes [@jiaTop10Research2019; @sonejaExposureExtremeHeat2016; @williamsSocialDeterminantsTaking2009]. Additionally, many of these studies to not ask how these relationships may vary by social factors like ethnicity or poverty both at the individual level and in communities [@Ayres-Sampaio2014; @delamaterAnalysisAsthmaHospitalizations2012] although many studies show that they do [@linExtremeHighTemperatures2009].

Likewise, while many studies research the relationship between health outcomes and the built and physical environment, few exam how this relationship is mediated by social factors 






How do social determinants of health interact with climate and urban infrastructure and environment to produce variabilities in public health outcomes?
