# Introduction {#intro}

Approximately 55\% of the global population lives in urban areas with this number expected to increase to two-thirds by 2050 [@UnitedNations2019]. Urbanization is accompanied by a suite of surface modifications that affect the surface-energy balance, hydrological flows, and the abundance of vegetation, creating distinct and varied microclimates [@Pickett2001]. These modifications vary spatially, creating uneven landscapes of environmental externalities and benefits as well as infrastructure access. These spatial variations in turn affect and are affected by demographics and are often distinct along income and racial lines [@Heynan2006]. Systematic inequalities arise from zoning practices and disinvestment and have a long historical legacy [@Wolch2014]. These three subsystems–meteorological, environmental, and social–are highly interdependent with complex feedbacks, and interact in complex ways characterized by non-linear dynamics and thresholding behaviors, operating across a variety of spatial and temporal scales [@Liu2007; @Liu2007a; @McPhearson2016; @Pickett2001; @costanzaModelingComplexEcological1993a]. To understand urban systems, these components must be examined simultaneously in relation to each other [@Pickett2001].

Climate change and increasing urban populations will likely alter the interactions of these subsystems [@ebiClimateChangeTropospheric2008]. While urbanization is generally seen as a positive force for human development and poverty reduction, unmanaged urbanization has the potential for environmental degradation and inequitable sharing of positive outcomes [@UnitedNations2019]. Understanding how these systems currently interact is imperative to understanding how to best manage urbanization to minimize disruption and increase equity [@McPhearson2016]. Human beings affect and are effected by all three of these systems and their interactions [@Ferraro2019; @Liu2007; @Liu2007a; @Pickett2001].

Public health can be defined as the health of entire populations and is best understood as a complex system arising from the interaction of subsystems [@Trochim2006]. As the world becomes increasingly urban, understanding the dynamics of public health in urban environments and their interactions with climate, the environment, and society becomes increasingly important [@Bai2018].  Understanding the structural and spatial variability of public health across these domains can allow for better public policies and resource allocation [@McPhearson2016; @jiaTop10Research2019]. Without equity in health, cities cannot be considered sustainable, a primary goal of the United Nations [@UnitedNations2019; @McPhearson2016]. 

Weather affects human health in both the long and short terms. Besides disasters like floods and tornadoes, everyday meteorological conditions affect health as well. Extremes of heat and cold can exacerbate existing conditions and affect cardiovascular and respiratory function and may lead to increased mortality [@ferreirabragaTimeCourseWeatherRelated2001; @sonejaExposureExtremeHeat2016]. Heat also facilitates the formation of ground-level ozone which is a known to adversely affect respiratory function [@ebiClimateChangeTropospheric2008] and climatic factors influence the concentration of air pollutants [@damatoEnvironmentalRiskFactors2005]. Precipitation and wind affect the severity of allergen concentrations [@sonejaExposureExtremeHeat2016]. Atmospheric pressure and humidity likewise have effects on human health. These effects often occur at a temporal lag [@Liu2007a; @Liu2007]. Not only do atmospheric conditions affect public health, but they do so differentially across social groups [@Liu2007a]. 

Urban infrastructure and environment vary spatially within the urban context and are likely to produce variabilities in health based on proximity to features [@srinivasanCreatingHealthyCommunities2003; @chenSpatiotemporalRelationshipParticle2007]. There is evidence that residential proximity to point source pollution is associated with long-term respiratory effects [@buteauReviewEffectAir2019] and proximity to high traffic areas with asthma-related hospitalizations [@wilhelmEnvironmentalPublicHealth2008; @chenSpatiotemporalRelationshipParticle2007; @liAsthmaExacerbationProximity2011]. In a 20-year longitudinal study, @jamesAssociationImprovedAir2015 found measurable improvements in pediatric lung-function associated with improvements in PM levels. @spencer-hwangRespiratoryHealthRisks2015 found reduced lung function in children attending school near a major railyard. Greenspace is known to reduce land surface temperature just as impervious surfaces are known to increase it [@okeEnergeticBasisUrban1982]. Urban core areas are affected by the urban heat island where the increased percentage of impervious surfaces elevates temperatures. Age and material of housing stock are also likely to impact the health of residents [@stewartLocalClimateZones2012].

It is well known that large disparities of health outcomes exist across socio-economic spectra, with minorities and the poor having the worst outcomes [@geeEnvironmentalHealthDisparities2004; @samuels-kalowUseGeographicData2019; @baileyStructuralRacismHealth2017]. These social determinants of health vary spatially along with physical and environmental determinants of health through residential segregation and structural racism [@geeEnvironmentalHealthDisparities2004; @hoffmanEffectsHistoricalHousing2020; @baileyStructuralRacismHealth2017]. Environmental exposure is unevenly distributed along with the associated health risks and communities of color are frequently subject to economic disinvestment and lack of economic and political opportunities [@schulzRACEDISTRIBUTIONSOCIAL2016; @baileyStructuralRacismHealth2017]. Additionally, there is often a surfeit of dilapidated housing stock and reduced access to quality education and healthcare as a result of continued civic disinvestment [@baileyStructuralRacismHealth2017].

Asthma prevalence is associated with a host of demographic and environmental exposure factors [@fordConsiderationsRegardingEpidemiology2010] making an attractive case study to analyze the complex interactions of atmospheric, environmental, and social systems. Asthma has been shown to be associated with temperature, humidity, thunderstorms, allergens, air pollution, greenspace, proximity to transportation corridors, minority status, and poverty [@sonejaExposureExtremeHeat2016; @mirekuChangesWeatherEffects2009; @raunUsingCommunityLevel2014; @trivediAsthmaChildrenAdults2019; @Won2016; @liAsthmaExacerbationProximity2011].

Asthma is a chronic inflammation of the airways characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, and tightness of chest associated with airflow obstruction [@fordConsiderationsRegardingEpidemiology2010; @Won2016]. It is not a disease but rather a diverse disorder that affects both children and adults although with somewhat different presentations [@trivediAsthmaChildrenAdults2019]. In the United States pediatric asthma is associated with 50 billion dollars in healthcare expenditures annually and causes significant disruptions to both children and parents due to absenteeism [@trivediAsthmaChildrenAdults2019]. It is the most common chronic condition of childhood in developed nations [@milliganAsthmaUrbanChildren2016]. Pediatric asthma doubled in the United States between 1980 and 1995 and although overall growth has slowed since then, racial disparities increased [@akinbamiChangingTrendsAsthma2016]. Minority and low-income children are disproportionately affected in terms of prevalence rates, morbidity, and mortality [@trivediAsthmaChildrenAdults2019; @Won2016]. 

Studying the interactions of urban systems and their relationship with public health requires both an outcome and an instance. The proposed research seeks to explore and describe pediatric asthma in the Kansas City metropolitan area as an example of the variability of public health and how that relates to the spatial and temporal variabilities and interactions of atmospheric conditions, environmental characteristics, and social factors. How do social determinants of health interact with climate and urban infrastructure and environment to produce variabilities in public health outcomes?
