## Urban systems and public health

Approximately 55\% of the global population lives in urban areas with this number expected to increase to two-thirds by 2050 [@UnitedNations2019]. Urbanization is accompanied by a suite of surface modifications that effect the surface-energy balance, hydrological flows, and the abundance of vegetation, creating distinct and varied microclimates [@Pickett2001]. These modifications vary spatially, creating uneven landscapes of environmental externalities and benefits as well as infrastructure access. These spatial variations in turn affect and are affected by demographics and are often distinct along income and racial lines [@Heynan2006]. Systematic inequalities arise from zoning practices and disinvestment and have a long historical legacy [@Wolch2014]. These three subsystems–meteorological, physical, and social–are highly interdependent with complex feedbacks, and interact in complex ways characterized by non-linear dynamics and thresholding behaviors, operating across a variety of spatial and temporal scales [@Liu2007; @Liu2007a; @McPhearson2016]. 

Climate change and increasing urban populations will alter the interactions of these subsystems []. While urbanization is generally seen as a positive force for human development and poverty reduction, unmanaged urbanization has the potential for environmental degradation and inequitable sharing of positive outcomes [@UnitedNations2019]. Understanding how these systems currently interact is imperative to understanding how to best manage urbanization to minimize disruptoion and increase equity []. Human beings affect and are effected by all three of these systems and their interactions, a key measure of which is public health []. Without equity in health, cities cannot be considered sustainable, a primary goal of the United Nations []. 

Public health can be defined as the health of entire populations, from neighborhoods to cities to countries and on [@Trochim2006]. As the world becomes increasingly urban, understanding the dynamics of public health in urban environments and how they interact with climate, the environment, and society becomes increasingly important.  Understanding the structural variability of public health across these domains can allow for better public policies and resource allocation [@McPhearson2016]. 

Asthma is a chronic inflammation of the airways characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, and tightness of chest associated with airflow obstruction [@fordConsiderationsRegardingEpidemiology2010; @Won2016]. It is not a disease but rather a diverse disorder that affects both children and adults althought with somewhat different presentations [@trivediAsthmaChildrenAdults2019]. In the United States pediatric asthma is associated with 50 billion in healthcare expenditures annually and causes significant distruptions to both children and parents due to absenteeism [@trivediAsthmaChildrenAdults2019]. Pediatric asthma doubled in the United States between 1980 and 1995 and although overall growth has slowed since then, racial disparities increased [@akinbamiChangingTrendsAsthma2016]. Minority and low-income children are disproportionately affected in terms of prevalence rates, morbidity, and mortality [@trivediAsthmaChildrenAdults2019; @Won2016]. Asthma prevalence is associated with a host of demographic and environmental exposure factors [@fordConsiderationsRegardingEpidemiology2010]. 

It is intuitive to understand that weather has an effect on human health. Besides disasters like floods and tornadoes, everyday meteorological conditions effect health as well. Extremes of heat and cold can exacerbate existing conditions and effect cardiovascular and respiratory function and may lead to increased mortality [@ferreirabragaTimeCourseWeatherRelated2001; @sonejaExposureExtremeHeat2016]. Heat also facilitates the formation of ground-level ozone and precipitation and wind effect the severity of allergen concentrations. Atmospheric pressure and humidity likewise have effects on human health. These effects often occur at a temporal lag. Not only do atmospheric condictions affect public health, but they do so differentially across social groups [@Liu2007a]. 

It is well known that large disparities of health outcomes exist across socio-economic spectra, with minorities and the poor having the worst outcomes [@geeEnvironmentalHealthDisparities2004]. These social determinants of health also vary spatially often along with the physical determinants of health present through racial segregation in the urban system [@geeEnvironmentalHealthDisparities2004; @hoffmanEffectsHistoricalHousing2020]. Urban infrastructure and environment vary spatially within the urban context and are likely to produce variabilities in health based on proximity to features [@srinivasanCreatingHealthyCommunities2003]. Highways and railways are major sources of pollution as are power plants and other large electrical facilities. Greenspace is known to reduce land surface temperature just as impervious surfaces are known to increase it [@okeEnergeticBasisUrban1982]. Urban core areas are effected by the urban heat island where the increased percentage of impervious surfaces elevates temperatures. Age and material of housing stock are also likely to impact the health of residents [@stewartLocalClimateZones2012].

Studying the interactions of urban systems and the relationship with public health requires both an outcome and an instance. The proposed research seeks to explore and describe pediatric asthma in the Kansas City metropolitan area as an example of the variability of public health and how that relates to the spatial and temporal variabilites and interactions of atmospheric conditions, enviromental characteristics, and social factors. How do social determinants of health interact with climate and urban infrastructure and environment to produce variabilities in public health outcomes?
