## Urban systems and public health

Approximately 55\% of the global population lives in urban areas with this number expected to increase to two-thirds by 2050 [@UnitedNations2019]. Urbanization is accompanied by a suite of surface modifications that effect the surface-energy balance, hydrological flows, and the availability of vegetation, creating distinct and varied microclimates [@Pickett2001]. These modifications vary spatially, creating uneven landscapes of environmental externalities and benefits as well as infrastructure access. These spatial variations in turn affect and are effected by demographics and are often distinct along income and racial lines [@Heynan2006]. Systematic inequalities arise from zoning practices and disinvestment and have a long historical legacy [@Wolch2014]. These three subsystems–meteorological, physical, and social–are highly interdependent with complex feedbacks, and interact in complex ways characterized by non-linear dynamics and thresholding behaviors, operating across a variety of spatial and temporal scales [@Liu2007; @Liu2007a; @McPhearson2016]. Understanding the interactions of these subsystems is crucial to understanding cities as coupled human-natural systems, which is itself crucial to understanding the spatial variability of public health in urban areas.

Public health can be defined as the health of entire populations, from neighborhoods to cities to countries and on [@Trochim2006]. As the world becomes increasingly urban, understanding the dynamics of public health in urban environments and how they interact with climate, the environment, and society becomes increasingly important.  Understanding the structural variability of public health across these domains can allow for better public policies [@McPhearson2016].

It is intuitive to understand that weather has an effect on human health. Besides disasters like floods and tornadoes, everyday meteorological conditions effect health as well. Extremes of heat and cold can exacerbate existing conditions and effect cardiovascular and respiratory function and may lead to increased mortality [@ferreirabragaTimeCourseWeatherRelated2001; @sonejaExposureExtremeHeat2016]. Heat also facilitates the formation of ground-level ozone and precipitation and wind effect the severity of allergen concentrations. Atmospheric pressure and humidity likewise have effects on human health. These effects often occur at a temporal lag. Not only do atmospheric condictions affect public health, but they do so differentially across social groups [@Liu2007a].

Urban infrastructure and environment vary spatially within the urban context and are likely to produce variabilities in health based on proximity to features. Highways and railways are major sources of pollution as are power plants and other large electrical facilities. Greenspace is known to reduce land surface temperature just as impervious surfaces are known to increase it [@okeEnergeticBasisUrban1982]. Urban core areas are effected by the urban heat island where the increased percentage of impervious surfaces elevates temperatures. Age and material of housing stock are also likely to impact the health of residents [@stewartLocalClimateZones2012].

It is well known that large disparities of health outcomes exist across socio-economic spectra, with minorities and the poor having the worst outcomes [@geeEnvironmentalHealthDisparities2004]. These social determinants of health also vary spatially often along with the physical determinants of health present through racial segregation in the urban system [@geeEnvironmentalHealthDisparities2004; @hoffmanEffectsHistoricalHousing2020]. It is essential to understand how the social determinants interact with the climatic and physical systems to produce variabilities in public health vulnerability in order to prioritize the distribution of resources. 

While there are many studies of the relationship between health outcomes in relation to urban heat, heat waves, and other atmospheric conditions like air pollution levels, the public health data are often too aggregated to get a sense of the spatial dependency of these relationships [@Anderson2009; @Ayres-Sampaio2014; @babinPediatricPatientAsthmarelated2007; @delamaterAnalysisAsthmaHospitalizations2012; @ferreirabragaTimeCourseWeatherRelated2001; @mirekuChangesWeatherEffects2009; @sonejaExposureExtremeHeat2016]. Patterns of these variables vary spatially [@okeEnergeticBasisUrban1982; @Jerrett2008super] in ways that affect exposure and health outcomes [@jiaTop10Research2019; @sonejaExposureExtremeHeat2016; @williamsSocialDeterminantsTaking2009]. Additionally, many of these studies to not ask how these relationships may vary by social factors like ethnicity or poverty [@Ayres-Sampaio2014; @delamaterAnalysisAsthmaHospitalizations2012] although many studies show that they do [@linExtremeHighTemperatures2009]. Relationships between health and the urban atmosphere need to be considered not only at the system level (county or metro area) or community level (zip code or census block group) but also at the individual level. 

Likewise, while many studies research the relationship between health outcomes and the built and physical environment, most are focused on the benefits of greenspace or the negatives of busy transportation corridors [need citation]. While these may highlight the differential effects of these relationships across social groups, they often do so without simultaneously considering the relationship between the built and physical environment and the urban atmosphere [citation?]. It has been well established that increased impervious surfaces and the lack of greenspace in urban areas contribute to the urban heat island effect (UHI) where temperatures are higher in urban areas relative to surrounding rural areas [@okeEnergeticBasisUrban1982]. It has also been shown that areas that were subject to redlining have increased temperatures relative to areas that were greenlined [@hoffmanEffectsHistoricalHousing2020]. Research also shows that there are significant income and racial disparities in access to public greenspace [@abercrombieIncomeRacialDisparities2008]. Increased heat has significant negative effects on health [@Horton2016]. So how to disentangle these factors? Although it seems to be the privelage of a discipline to decide which variables to consider mediating, moderating, or confounding this avoids the need to characterize urban systems not as partitions of relationships but as complex, hierarchical, and coupled.







How do social determinants of health interact with climate and urban infrastructure and environment to produce variabilities in public health outcomes?
