The long-standing paradigm for studying urban systems was to conceptualize them as human systems superimposed upon natural systems. It has become clear that a more accurate model is that of coupled and natural systems which explicitly characterize the multidirectional and dynamic interactions between these systems. The modelling of coupled and human natural systems requires statistical techniques that unite data across spatial and temporal scales and can derive meaning over many levels of uncertainty. Improving these techniques will be key to predicting the effects of climate change on public health. Understading how human and natural systems are coupled requires modeling the couplings across spatial and temporal scales [@Liu2007a].

The study of urban systems is usually siloed within separate disciplines [@Bai2018]. It is inefficient to study human and natural systems separately when attempting to undestand their interactions [@Liu2007a]. Likewise, research is usually done in the abstract, without a focused eye to solving real-world problems. Research should provide usable solutions [@Liu2007a; @McPhearson2016]. Addressing these problems successfully involves transdisciplinary work that can examine urban systems as intersections of social, physical, environmental, and atmospheric systems [@Bai2018; @McPhearson2016]. Understanding urban systems is a critical first step in understanding how they may respond to climate change [@Bai2018]. If risk can be understood quanititatively it can be projected under different climate change scenarios [@McMichael2012]. Measures of public health can be used as an outcome for modelling these coupled human and natural systems.
