Pediatric asthma offers an intriguing case study for modeling urban systems as it is associated with a host of demographic and environmental exposure factors [@fordConsiderationsRegardingEpidemiology2010]. Most studies focusing on the relationship between asthma---or other measures of public health---and climatic, environmental, and social systems ignore the complex and cross-scale interdependence of these systems [@Liu2007; @Liu2007a; @McPhearson2016; @Pickett2001; @costanzaModelingComplexEcological1993a]. These subsystems must be considered simultaneously with an emphasis on spatial and temporal hierarchies in order to understand how urban systems function as coupled human-natural systems [@Liu2007a; @Liu2007]. Much of the work that has been done in this regard has been theoretical rather than empirical, yet empirical and inductive research has much to offer in terms of understanding the relationships and structures that comprise urban systems [@Liu2007]. Describing urban systems is a critical first step toward understanding how they may respond to climate change [@Bai2018] and how this may affect public health [@McMichael2012], and toward providing usable solutions to these problems [@Liu2007a; @McPhearson2016].

This research will provide a framework for modeling urban systems as coupled-human natural systems by integrating climatic, environmental, and social factors across temporal and spatial scales. The modeling process and analysis of the results will be an empirical exploration of pediatric asthma as a manifestation of the interaction of these factors. While the results may not be generalizable to other public health outcomes or to urban areas other than the Kansas City metro area, we anticipate that the modeling framework will be applicable to any number of urban public health analyses including estimating vulnerability to climate change impacts.

The long-standing paradigm for studying urban systems has been to conceptualize them as human systems superimposed upon natural systems. A more realistic paradigm is that of coupled and natural systems, an explicit characterization of the multidirectional and dynamic interactions between climatic, environmental, and social factors. The modeling of coupled and human natural systems requires advanced statistical techniques that unite data across spatial and temporal scales and that derive meaning over many levels of uncertainty [@Liu2007a]. Improving these techniques will be key to predicting the effects of climate change on public health.
