Pediatric asthma offers an intriguing case study for modeling urban systems as it is associated with a host of demographic and environmental exposure factors [@fordConsiderationsRegardingEpidemiology2010]. Although there are many studies concerning the relationship between asthma---or other measures of public health---and climatic, environmental, and social systems they are primarily addressed independently of one another. However these systems interact in complex ways and are highly interdependent, with each system and their interactions operating at a multitude of spatial and temporal scales [@Liu2007; @Liu2007a; @McPhearson2016; @Pickett2001; @costanzaModelingComplexEcological1993a]. To understand the greater urban system, these subsystems must be considered simultaneously with an emphasis on spatial and temporal hierarchies [@Liu2007a; @Liu2007]. 

Much of the work that has been done with coupled human-natural systems has been theoretical rather than empirical, yet empirical and inductive research has much to offer in terms of understanding general relationships and structures [@Liu2007]. Understanding the structure of urban systems is a critical first step in understanding how they may respond to climate change [@Bai2018] and how this may affect public health [@McMichael2012]. Research should provide usable solutions [@Liu2007a; @McPhearson2016] and successfully answering these questions involves transdisciplinary work that can examine urban systems as intersections of climatic, environmental, and social systems [@Bai2018; @McPhearson2016]. 

The long-standing paradigm for studying urban systems has been to conceptualize them as human systems superimposed upon natural systems. A more realistic paradigm is that of coupled and natural systems, an explicit characterization of the multidirectional and dynamic interactions between them. The modeling of coupled and human natural systems requires advanced statistical techniques that unite data across spatial and temporal scales and can derive meaning over many levels of uncertainty [@Liu2007a]. Improving these techniques will be key to predicting the effects of climate change on public health.
