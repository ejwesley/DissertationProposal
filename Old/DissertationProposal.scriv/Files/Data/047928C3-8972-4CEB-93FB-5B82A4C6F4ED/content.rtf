one of the greatest challenges for scaling in real landscapes is to integrate biophysical with socioeconomic processes. This is especially true for human-dominated landscapes (e.g., agricultural and urban landscapes) where natural and anthropogenic processes are intertwined and often operate on different scales. The mechanics and rules of scaling for different processes may also vary dramatically. When it comes to the practice of scaling, universality is elegant, but more of utopia; idiosyncrasy is torturous, but more of reality. Complex interdisciplinary issues call for a hierarchical, pluralistic scaling strategy that integrates both empirical statistical and dynamic modeling methods. \\cite\{Wu2007\}}
