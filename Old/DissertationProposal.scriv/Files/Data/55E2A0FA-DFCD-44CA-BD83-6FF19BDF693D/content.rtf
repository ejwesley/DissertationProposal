\f0\fs28 \cf0 It has been shown that gridded climate data, i.e., air temperatures, can indeed reproduce UHI effects, thus showing elevated temperatures in urban compared to rural grid cells, however, at very high spatial resolutions of1x1 km [85]. With a resolution of1/2\uc0\u730  x 1/2\u730 , and 2\u730  x 2\u730  respectively, the underlying climate data used for this analysis is considerably coarser. Thus, the UHI effect is not expected to be directly or reliably observed due to the mixing of urban and rural grid cells. Consequently, since heat stress is further exacerbated by the UHI, the estimated parameters may actually be underestimating climate change impacts on cities. \\cite\{Scheuer2017\}}
