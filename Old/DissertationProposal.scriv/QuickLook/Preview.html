<p class="itemTextStart">Cities and city regions are sufficiently dense and of a spatial scale that they influence their local micro-climate. Climate change will interact with these conditions in a variety of ways, some of which will exacerbate the level of climate risk \cite{Revi2014}</p>

<p class="itemTextStart">Researchers, policymakers, practitioners and other city stakeholders need to strengthen partnerships and produce knowledge together.

<p class="itemTextStart">It is essential to acknowledge the societal-level contexts and constraints and the many feedback loops and reciprocities characterizing dynamic systems and real lives.

<li>
<p class="itemTextStart">Climate change will have profound impacts on a broad spectrum of infrastructure systems (water and energy supply, sanitation and drainage, transport and telecommunication), services (including health care and emergency services), the built environment, and ecosystem services. These interact with other social, economic, and environmental stressors exacerbating and compounding risks to individual and household well-being \cite{Revi2014}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTextStart">For each of the direct and indirect impacts of climate change, there are groups of urban dwellers that face higher risks (illness, injury, mortality, damage to or loss of homes and assets, disruption to incomes) \cite{Revi2014}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTextStart">typically, the larger the deficit in infrastructure and service provision, the larger the differentials in exposure to most climate change impacts between income groups. \cite{Revi2014}</p>

<p class="itemTextStart">vulnerability is often discussed in relation to particular population groups while \cite{Revi2014}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTextStart">resilience is more often discussed in relation to the systemic capacity to protect them and reduce the impact of particular hazards through infrastructure or climate-risk sensitive land use management. \cite{Revi2014}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTextStart">resilience looks at the performance of each city’s complex and interconnected infrastructure and institutional systems including interdependence between multiple sectors, levels, and risks in a dynamic physical, economic, institutional, and socio-political environment \cite{Revi2014}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTextStart">climate change impacts are not currently dominant issues for urban centers (WGII AR4 Section 7.1.3). Their importance lies in their interaction with other stressors, which may include rapid population growth, political instability, poverty and inequality, ineffective local governments, jurisdictional fragmentation, and aging or inadequate infrastructure \cite{Revi2014}</p>

<p class="itemTextStart">Understanding urbanization and associated risk and vulnerability distributions is critical for an effective response to climate change threats and their impacts \cite{Revi2014}</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTextStart">climate change may affect the future social and environmental determinants of health, including clean air, safe drinking water, sufficient food, and secure shelter. There is good evidence that temperature extremes (heat and cold) affect health, particularly mortality rates \cite{Revi2014}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTextStart">The ecological and socioeconomic patterns and processes in urban coupled systems are different from those in rural areas. They are mediated by factors such as the urban form, built infrastructure, and location and consumption preferences of heterogeneous households and businesses</span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1"></p>

<li>
<p class="itemTextStart">Dynamics of human-nature systems are influenced by many factors, including government policies and contextual factors in which local processes are shaped by larger-scale and ultimately global-scale processes</p>

<p class="itemTextStart"></span></p></p>
<p class="itemText"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">To further our knowledge of urbanization’s effects on people, biodiversity, and ecosystem processes, urban ecologists must shift from studying patterns to untangling the emerging mechanistic processes behind the reported patterns (15). However, it is also crucial to create the tools and procedures for transforming scientific knowledge into action. \cite{McDonnell2016a}</p>

<p class="itemTextStart">This definition incorporates activities such as: identifying key concepts, their interconnections and feedback loops; understanding the structure of the system as a whole and at different scales; characterizing its dynamic behaviour; describing its inherent resources (such as infrastructure, money or trust) and how these change over time and context; revealing non-linear relationships; and using analysis to reduce complexity and generate insights.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p></p>

</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTextStart">Although country-level estimates are useful for international comparisons and benchmarking, they mask disparities in CGF at the lower administrative levels at which most health and nutrition policy planning and implementation occur. The value of precision public health in this context—the use of more spatially resolved data to guide efficient targeting of interventions to those populations with the greatest need—is increasingly recognized by the global health community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTextStart">Determining adaptation needs and identifying adaptation gaps relies heavily on knowledge about the magnitude of climate change at local level. Unfortunately, local knowledge is a heavily fragmented body of knowledge [21]. This fragmentation—in combination with a lack of scientific research and evidence at local levels, as well as a lack of public awareness, funding, and cooperation—poses an important barrier to adaptation</p>

<p class="itemTextStart">It has been shown that gridded climate data, i.e., air temperatures, can indeed reproduce UHI effects, thus showing elevated temperatures in urban compared to rural grid cells, however, at very high spatial resolutions of1x1 km [85]. With a resolution of1/2˚ x 1/2˚, and 2˚ x 2˚ respectively, the underlying climate data used for this analysis is considerably coarser. Thus, the UHI effect is not expected to be directly or reliably observed due to the mixing of urban and rural grid cells. Consequen...</p>

<p class="itemTextStart">To assess the health risks of mid- to long- term future climate projections, a concerted effort combining the use of process-based models (capturing the biology of the malaria system) alongside statistical modelling will be needed.</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTextStart">Potential impacts of long-term trends in mean temperatures on health, for example, on malaria incidence in the African highlands, have not been reliably detected.
