\section{Study 1: Temporal variability of severe pediatric asthma occurrence and meteorological conditions}





\subsection{Methods}


Poisson distributed lag nonlinear models will be used to examine the relationship between severe asthma occurence and meteorological variables.
The Poisson family of functions model count data while the lag nonlinear models incorporate a temporal lag effects without making assumptions of linearity.
